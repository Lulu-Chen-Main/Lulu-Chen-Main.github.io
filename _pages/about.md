Dr. Lulu Chen (she/her) is a PostDoctoral Associate in the Department of Environmnetal and Occupational Health. She received her BSc in Atmospheric Sciences from Nanjing University and her PhD in Atmospheric Physics and Atmospheric Environment from Peking University.
Her research has been focused on the ambient air pollution, and the interdisciplinary intersections with climate change, public human health, trade activities, equity and policy.

"The infinite distance, the countless peopleï¼Œthey are all connected to me." This quote from the writer Lu Xun encapsulates my research interests. For those of us living on Earth, air pollution and climate change affect everyone, every moment of every day. Transboundary transport of emissions caused by atmospheric transport and trade activities link people across time and space in complex ways. We are constantly influencing global pollution and climate while simultaneously being impacted by them (such as pollution-related health impacts) amid significant inequities in how these burdens are distributed. My research aims to provide a clearer understanding of these intricate processes and to contribute to identifying the most effective solutions.
